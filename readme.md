# Love the office?

This is the backend-side of my [office quote project](https://github.com/nilssoncjonas/office-api)

The backend side of the API-project is made with Node.js, express, typescript and prisma with an MySQL database. The quotes is stored in the databse and then fetch with a request from the api-server.
The API itself is currently hosted at Cyclic and the database is hosted at Clever-cloud. Both these services are free tiers and the speed, especially to the database is accordingly to that...🥴
